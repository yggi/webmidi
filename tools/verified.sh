# Lifted from yggi/cells tools/verified.sh @ e0a2274 (its stamps renamed `webmidi-…`).
# The stamp of a tree that passed `npm run verify`, read by the pre-push hook (.githooks/pre-push), so a push right after
# a verify run by hand doesn't run it again, and still says how many tests passed. The stamps are lines
# `<tree> <tests passed>` in the repository's common git directory (`webmidi-verified`), shared by its linked worktrees, since
# a tree is the same files whichever checkout verified it (#242); a line of a tree alone, from before the count was kept,
# reads as a count unknown. What a run is doing (`webmidi-verifying`, `webmidi-tests-passed`) stays with its own worktree.
#
#   begin  (npm's `preverify`) records the tree verify is about to check: the checkout's files as they are, tracked or
#          not, but not ignored, written as a git tree through a scratch index (the real index is left alone). It also
#          points `core.hooksPath` at .githooks when it points elsewhere, and says so, so a clone's first verify installs
#          the pre-push gate: no install script may (a frontend installs webmidi from git, tools/hooks.test.ts). It
#          removes a count an earlier test run left, which is not this run's.
#   end [n] (npm's `postverify`, which npm runs only when verify passed) stamps that tree, unless a file changed while
#          verify ran, with `n` tests passed, or the count verify's reporter kept (`webmidi-tests-passed`,
#          tools/test-count.ts), used once, or `?`. A commit of exactly those files then has that tree, and the hook
#          finds it.
#
# Outside a git checkout, or at `end` with nothing begun, it does nothing: verify's result never depends on it.
