# Lifted from yggi/cells tools/verified.sh @ 41ef16b (its stamps renamed `webmidi-…`).
# The stamp of a tree that passed `npm run verify`, read by the pre-push hook (.githooks/pre-push), so a push right after
# a verify run by hand doesn't run it again. The stamps are tree hashes, one to a line, in the git directory
# (`webmidi-verified`).
#
#   begin  (npm's `preverify`) records the tree verify is about to check: the checkout's files as they are, tracked or
#          not, but not ignored, written as a git tree through a scratch index (the real index is left alone). It also
#          points `core.hooksPath` at .githooks when it points elsewhere, and says so, so a clone's first verify installs
#          the pre-push gate: no install script may (a frontend installs webmidi from git, tools/hooks.test.ts).
#   end    (npm's `postverify`, which npm runs only when verify passed) stamps that tree, unless a file changed while
#          verify ran. A commit of exactly those files then has that tree, and the hook finds it.
#
# Outside a git checkout, or at `end` with nothing begun, it does nothing: verify's result never depends on it.
